The code written in these documents have been written for proof of my own development skills with 
python and not as evidence of my work commercially.

What is this repository? And what is its purpose?
=================================================
This is a toy website that will hopefully perform some useful data manipulations or filtering.

The goal of this repository is to show off some of the skills I have developed in my time learning python and developing
software in python. As well as some of the logical elements to solutions to specific problems like the expensive use of 
the .loc method for pandas DataFrames, which have to search the entire DataFrame to find specific instances, even when 
the data has been sorted appropriately.
